//
// It starts from the default branch's file ("theirs": its header, its records, its order), then for each record:
// - only the branch changed it (or added it): the branch's version;
// - only the default branch changed it, or archived it: the default branch's;
// - both changed it differently: the default branch's version stays and the record is named, to merge by hand (exit 1).
// Paragraphs under "## Other changes" that only the branch has are added. Never keep one side's record wholesale: that
// silently drops the other side's edits to records both have.
